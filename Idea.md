# EyeSeeMusik

This should be something that combines the concepts of music and design.

Here by music i mean:
- can be something the user plays
- can be something that is already made.
- can be something that the user modifies

Here by design i mean:
- can be illustrations
- can be random designs from js framworks such as particle js
- can be cool looking images of art or natural photographed

SomeIdeas:

Music Visualiser or Visualiser:
- Normal visualiser randomly keeps generating cool graphics for webpage.
- gets better character when music is being played
- generates amazing walls for background of website or just side walls and divisions.

___Cool Idea No Name yet___:
- Musical Interface of app.
- user selects musical arrangement from given options(options will be already existing notes and stuff and such).
- user selects musical tones from given options.
- Cool graphical interaction.
- Objective:App Generates an Image Filter Based on type of music being played.

A Game:
- Can play/select various songs (in order like OSU!(pianotiles thingy like) and change settings of app to everytime 
generate various random new background images.

Something More Complex(Farfetched):
- Uses machine learning to make musical arrangements based on users prerference
- generates design based on what is being played given some criteria specified by user.
- goals acheived music is made and with a solid design is made to.
